This started out a personal markerpack while I was doing map completion. Now it's 650+ markers.


This is meant to be general guide and not hard fact. 
I tried checking to be sure there were no events in the areas marked but it's impossible to catch everything.
Please examine areas before putting on a big event at these spots. I'm not responsible for legendary mobs 
spawning in during your market event. lol
Also, tell me if a legendary mob spawns during your market event. I'll remove it from the pack. lol

Please thanks to Nyx for helping with testing.
